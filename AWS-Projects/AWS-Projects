ChatGPT Prompt: Create a list of 20 beginner devOps engineer project ideas involving Linux, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible on AWS


Here's a list of 20 beginner DevOps engineer project ideas involving Linux, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, and Ansible on AWS:

1. Linux Server Provisioning with Terraform: Automate the creation of Linux servers on AWS using Terraform. Deploy web servers on these instances.

2. Continuous Integration with Jenkins: Set up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy a web application hosted on AWS.

3. Kubernetes Cluster on AWS: Create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using Kubernetes Operations (KOPS) and manage its lifecycle.

4. Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Deployment: Deploy a containerized application on AWS EKS and set up automatic scaling using Kubernetes HPA.

5. Monitoring AWS Resources with Prometheus and Grafana: Set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor AWS EC2 instances, RDS databases, and more.

6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform: Build a comprehensive IaC project to provision AWS resources, including VPCs, subnets, and security groups, using Terraform.

7. Automated AWS Backup Solution: Create a solution using AWS Lambda and S3 to automatically back up critical data and resources.

8. Server Configuration Management with Ansible: Use Ansible to automate server configurations, updates, and security hardening on AWS EC2 instances.

9. AWS Auto Scaling Groups: Implement auto-scaling for an application on AWS using Auto Scaling Groups to adjust capacity based on traffic.

10. Kubernetes Logging and Log Analysis: Configure Fluentd and Elasticsearch on Kubernetes for centralized logging and use Kibana for log analysis.

11. AWS Multi-Region Deployment: Deploy your application across multiple AWS regions for high availability and disaster recovery.

12. Terraform and AWS CloudFront: Use Terraform to set up AWS CloudFront for content delivery and global caching.

13. Jenkins Blue Ocean Pipelines: Implement Jenkins Blue Ocean pipelines to simplify and visualize CI/CD workflows.

14. AWS Lambda Functions with Terraform: Create AWS Lambda functions to perform serverless tasks and use Terraform for infrastructure management.

15. Security Compliance Checks with Ansible: Develop Ansible playbooks to perform security compliance checks on AWS resources.

16. Prometheus Alerting: Set up Prometheus alerting rules to receive notifications for critical events in your AWS infrastructure.

17. AWS S3 Data Backup Automation: Automate data backups from AWS EC2 instances to AWS S3 buckets using AWS CLI and scripts.

18. Cost Optimization Dashboard with Grafana: Create a Grafana dashboard to monitor and visualize AWS cost and resource usage.

19. Jenkins Job DSL and Pipelines: Implement Jenkins Job DSL and scripted pipelines to manage and version-control Jenkins job configurations.

20. Kubernetes Ingress Controllers on AWS: Configure Kubernetes Ingress controllers to route traffic to applications running on AWS EKS clusters.

These project ideas cover a wide range of DevOps concepts and technologies, providing valuable hands-on experience for beginners in DevOps engineering while leveraging the AWS cloud platform.
