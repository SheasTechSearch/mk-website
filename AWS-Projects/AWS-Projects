"AWS Projects"

ChatGPT Prompt: 
Create a list of 20 beginner devOps engineer project ideas involving Linux, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible, and AWS

Setup a Linux Web Server: 
Configure a Linux server to host a simple website using Apache or Nginx. Automate server provisioning with Terraform and Ansible.

Automated Deployment with Jenkins: 
Create a Jenkins pipeline to automate the deployment of a web application to a Kubernetes cluster whenever changes are pushed to a Git repository.

Kubernetes Cluster Setup: 
Build a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on AWS using Terraform, and deploy a basic application on it.

Kubernetes Autoscaling: 
Implement Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler to automatically adjust resources based on demand.

CI/CD Pipeline for Microservices: 
Develop a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to build and deploy microservices into Kubernetes.

Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana: 
Set up Prometheus for collecting metrics and Grafana for creating dashboards to monitor your applications and infrastructure.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform: 
Create Terraform scripts to provision and manage infrastructure resources on AWS, like EC2 instances, VPCs, and RDS databases.

Serverless Functions with AWS Lambda: 
Build a serverless application using AWS Lambda, and automate the deployment process using Jenkins.

Continuous Configuration Management: 
Use Ansible to maintain and update configurations across a fleet of servers, ensuring consistency.

Security Scanning with AWS Inspector: 
Integrate AWS Inspector into your CI/CD pipeline to perform automated security assessments of your AWS resources.

Elastic Container Service (ECS) Deployment: 
Deploy a containerized application on AWS ECS, automating the deployment with Jenkins and Terraform.

Blue-Green Deployment Strategy: 
Implement a blue-green deployment strategy for an application in Kubernetes using Jenkins and Terraform.

Log Aggregation with ELK Stack: 
Set up the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack to centralize and analyze log data from your infrastructure.

AWS CloudFormation Templates: 
Create AWS CloudFormation templates to automate the provisioning of resources and entire environments.

High Availability Setup: 
Build a highly available architecture on AWS using load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and data replication, managed through Terraform.

AWS Lambda Scheduled Tasks: 
Use AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events to automate routine tasks, like creating daily backups or resizing resources.

Container Orchestration with EKS: 
Deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) and manage it using Terraform and Jenkins.

Cost Optimization and Reporting: 
Develop scripts and dashboards to monitor and report on AWS resource usage and cost using Grafana and AWS Cost Explorer.

Multi-Cloud Orchestration: 
Extend your Terraform scripts to provision resources not only on AWS but also on other cloud providers like Azure or Google Cloud.

Disaster Recovery Plan: 
Create a disaster recovery plan that includes automated backups, failover, and recovery procedures for your critical applications and data on AWS.
